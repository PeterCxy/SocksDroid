/* The following regulates the IP Protocol support. Supported types are IPv4
 * and IPv6 (aka IPng). You may enable either or both of these protocols.
 * Enabling in this context means that support for the respective protocol
 * will be in the binary. When running the binary, one of the protocols may
 * be activated via command line switches. Note that activating both IPv4 and
 * IPv6 is pointless (and will not work because two UDP and two TCP threads
 * will be started that concur for ports). Because of that, it is not allowed.
 * When pdnsd runs with IPv6 activated it should be able to service queries
 * from IPv6 as well as from IPv4 hosts, provided that you host is configured
 * properly.
 * For each of the protocols there are two options: ENABLE_IPV4 and ENABLE_IPV6
 * control whether support for the respective protocol is available in the
 * binary. DEFAULT_IPV4 selects which protocol is enabled on pdnsd
 * startup by default. 1 means IPv4, while 0 means IPv6. If support for
 * a protocol was included in the executable, you can specify command line
 * parameters to activate or deactivate that protocol (the options are -4 and
 * -6), but it makes more sense to use the run_ipv4=on/off option in the
 * configuration file.
 * Make your choice. Note that IPv6 support is experimental in pdnsd.
 * In normal operation, you will currently only need IPv4. */

 * UDP_ONLY: This is undoubtedly the fastest query method, because
 *       no TCP negotiation needs to be done.
 * TCP_ONLY: This is slower than uo, but generally more secure
 *       against DNS spoofing. Note that some name servers on the
 *       internet do not support TCP queries, notably dnscache.
 * TCP_UDP: TCP, then UDP. If the TCP query fails with a "connection refused"-
 *       error or times out, the query is retried using UDP.
 * UDP_TCP: UDP, then TCP. If the UDP reply is truncated (i.e. the tc flag is set),
